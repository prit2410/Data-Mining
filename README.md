TF-IDF Information Retrieval System

Overview

This project implements a TF-IDF-based information retrieval system using the US Inaugural Addresses corpus. It processes user queries and retrieves the most relevant documents based on cosine similarity between TF-IDF vectors.

Features

Corpus Preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, and optional lemmatization.

TF-IDF Vectorization: Computes term frequency-inverse document frequency scores.

Query Processing: Processes user queries to match the corpus vocabulary.

Similarity Calculation: Uses cosine similarity to find and rank relevant documents.

Interactive Query Interface: Users can input queries and receive ranked document results.

Dependencies

Python 3.8+

scikit-learn

nltk

numpy
